# Task 2.3 Refactor Graph Search for Speed

---
## Context

You are an expert at UI/UX design and software front-end development and architecture. You are allowed to NOT know an answer. You are allowed to be uncertain. You are allowed to disagree with your task. If any of these things happen, halt your current process and notify the user immediately. You should not hallucinate. If you are unable to remember information, you are allowed to look it up again.

You are not allowed to hallucinate. You may only use data that exists in the files specified. You are not allowed to create new data if it does not exist in those files.

You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.

When writing code, your focus should be on creating new functionality that builds on the existing code base without breaking things that are already working. If you need to rewrite how existing code works in order to develop a new feature, please check your work carefully, and also pause your work and tell me (the human) for review before going ahead. We want to avoid software regression as much as possible.

I WILL REPEAT, WHEN UPDATING EXISTING CODE FILES, PLEASE DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING CODE, PLEASE ADD OR MODIFY COMPONENTS TO ALIGN WITH THE NEW FUNCTIONALITY. THIS INCLUDES SMALL DETAILS LIKE FUNCTION ARGUMENTS AND LIBRARY IMPORTS. REGRESSIONS IN THESE AREAS HAVE CAUSED UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND WE WANT TO AVOID THEM GOING FORWARD.

When you need to modify existing code (in accordance with the instruction above), please present your recommendation to the user before taking action, and explain your rationale.

If the data files and code you need to use as inputs to complete your task do not conform to the structure you expected based on the instructions, please pause your work and ask the human for review and guidance on how to proceed.

If you have difficulty finding mission critical updates in the codebase (e.g. .env files, data files) ask the user for help in finding the path and directory.

## First Principles for AI Development

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Code Locality | Keep related code together for improved readability and maintenance | Placing event handlers immediately after their components |
| Development Workflow | Follow a structured pattern: read instructions → develop plan → review with user → execute after approval | Presented radio button implementation plan before making changes |
| Minimal Surgical Changes | Make the smallest possible changes to achieve the goal with minimal risk | Added only the necessary code for the radio button without modifying existing functionality |
| Rigorous Testing | Test changes immediately after implementation to catch issues early | Ran the application after adding the radio button to verify it works |
| Clear Documentation | Document design decisions and patterns | Added comments explaining why global variables are declared before functions that use them |
| Consistent Logging | Use consistent prefixes for log messages to aid debugging | Added prefixes like "[PERSONA CHANGE]" and "[MEMORY LOAD]" |
| Sequential Approval Workflow | Present detailed plans, wait for explicit approval on each component, implement one change at a time, and provide clear explanations of data flows | Explained how the persona instructions flow from selection to prompt generation before implementing changes |
| Surgical Diff Principle | Show only the specific changes being made rather than reprinting entire code blocks | Highlighted just the 2 key modifications to implement personalization rather than presenting a large code block |
| Progressive Enhancement | Layer new functionality on top of existing code rather than replacing it; design features to work even if parts fail | Adding persona-specific instructions while maintaining default behavior when persona selection is unavailable |
| Documentation In Context | Add inline comments explaining *why* not just *what* code is doing; document edge cases directly in the code | Adding comments explaining persona state management and potential memory retrieval failures |
| Risk-Based Approval Scaling | Level of user approval should scale proportionately to the risk level of the task - code changes require thorough review; document edits can proceed with less oversight | Implementing a new function in the agent required step-by-step approval, while formatting improvements to markdown files could be completed in a single action |

> **Remember:** *One tiny change → test → commit. Repeat.*
