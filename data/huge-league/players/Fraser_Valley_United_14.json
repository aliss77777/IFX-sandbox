At 23 years old, he exhibits youthful energy and determination in his expression. His face features a strong jawline, high cheekbones, and warm brown eyes that convey focus and a competitive spirit. Short, dark hair is styled neatly, and a hint of scruff adds to his rugged charm.\n\nHe is dressed in the home kit of Fraser Valley United: a sleek, vibrant jersey predominantly in shades of green and white, highlighted with dynamic vertical stripes and the team's emblem emblazoned on the chest. The kit is complemented by matching shorts and knee-length socks adorned with subtle patterns, finished off with black cleats.\n\nWilliam strikes a confident pose, one foot slightly forward, exuding readiness and agility, as if he\u2019s just about to burst into action.
