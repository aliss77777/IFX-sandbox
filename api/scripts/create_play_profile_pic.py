You are generating a realistic portrait of a fictional professional soccer player using their structured profile data.

Use the information below to inform the player's:
- Physical build (age, height, weight)
- Facial features and vibe (bio, nationality, personality)
- Team kit details (team name, role, position)
- Pose and mood (based on form, rating, injury status)

Be creative, but grounded in realism â€” think press photo or matchday portrait.

Here is the player profile:

{player_profile}

Your output should describe only the image to be generated. No text, captions, or extra commentary. Just a detailed image prompt.
